# PUBG-Finish-Placement-Prediction

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to contain all the various R files used for Kaggle's "PUBG Finish Placement Prediction" challenge.  The challenge's aim is to predict the win placement percentile of players, given data from the game, where 1 is a win and 0 is last place and everything in between is essentially the percentile placement of the player.

## The Datasets
